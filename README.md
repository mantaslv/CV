## <a name="about-me">About Me</a>

Hello! I'm Mantas, a software engineer fresh from completing the Makers Academy bootcamp, where I honed my skills and prepared myself to transition fully into the tech landscape. Before this, I was trained in civil engineering, building a foundation that nurtured my analytical and detail-oriented mindset. As I furthered my career, I gained rich experiences in data analytics and fostered important customer and supplier relationships in the retail sector. While I value the educational background in civil engineering, it is the vibrant, innovative, and creative realm of software development that has captivated my true engineering spirit, motivating me to forge a path that allows for a greater scope of ingenuity and revolutionary solutions.

Having sharpened my technical skills at Makers Academy, I am now eager to apply my software engineering acumen to solve real-world problems. The bootcamp experience reinforced my belief in the power of collaborative learning and iterative development. I am particularly interested in crafting clean, test-driven code to create intuitive user interfaces and efficient backend systems. As I venture deeper into the tech landscape, I am excited about embracing new challenges, learning from seasoned professionals, and contributing to projects that drive meaningful impact. Through my blend of engineering discipline and newfound software development skills, I am ready to contribute fresh perspectives and innovative solutions in my next professional chapter.

#### Communication
- Presented technical concepts and project demonstrations to both technical and non-technical audiences during the final project at Makers Bootcamp.
- Taught Excel tutorial classes to the entire department at M&S, effectively communicating complex information in a clear and understandable manner.
- Led the project to modernize a legacy fabric supplier database and platform, collaborating directly with cross-cultural, global suppliers and the tech team to ensure successful implementation of the new platform.
#### Teamwork and Leadership
- During my time at Makers, I worked on several team agile projects and took turns leading daily standups, retrospectives, and sprint planning sessions. These experiences allowed me to ensure that each team member had clear roles and responsibilities while fostering a collaborative and supportive team culture.
- At Makers, I mentored developers who were more junior than me, providing guidance and support in their learning journey, helping them to overcome obstacles, and fostering a positive and inclusive team dynamic.
#### Adaptability
- Adapted to a new tech stack (MERN) and a legacy codebase while working on the Acebook project with a large team at makers in a short amount of time. When the team encountered a blocker, I suggested a combination of individual reading and hands-on feature building to help everyone get up to speed. By striking a balance between these approaches, I demonstrated my adaptability techniques and helped the team overcome the challenge.
- Took on new tasks and responsibilities outside of my usual role while moving from team to team in the packaging department at M&S. I brought my tech skills to each team and identified ways to best support them, showing my ability to adapt to different environments and work collaboratively with various stakeholders.
#### Problem Solving
- During my first project at Makers, MakersBnB, I was part of the smallest group in the cohort with a short project timeline of 1 week. I suggested using a small MVP approach, which allowed us to focus on the core functionalities and prioritize our tasks effectively. As a result, we were able to deliver the most functional project within the given timeframe.
- Identified that data processing was a major bottleneck for our department at M&S and presented a plan to my manager outlining a solution. This involved automating processes using macros and also running Excel tutorial sessions for the department. Took the initiative to learn VBA and successfully implemented the macros, which resulted in a significant increase in efficiency. Additionally, the tutorial classes improved the overall productivity of the team.
#### Time Management
- Successfully completed three projects at Makers by utilizing project management tools such as JIRA and T-shirt sizing to prioritize workloads, estimate task complexity and effort required, and ensure timely delivery of high-quality work.
#### Attention to Detail
- Displayed strong attention to detail through the use of code reviews at Makers. Consistently reviewed my own code and the code of my peers, giving constructive feedback and ensuring that our code met high quality standards. This process allowed us to catch errors and bugs early on, leading to more efficient development and a better end product.

## <a name="hobbies">Hobbies</a>

- **Rowing**: My other passion. After picking it up at uni, I joined Molesey BC, one of the UK's high-performance centres training full-time 2-3 times a day and qualified to compete at some international club regattas. I still keep up with it recreationally because there is nothing quite like cutting some glass on the River Thames on a crisp Saturday morning!
- **Sports**: Cycling, Running, Weightlifting, anything which allows me to push my body to its limits. I love using my wearable tech (WHOOP) to optimise this process - can't manage what you can't measure!
- **Tech News**: I am an avid subscriber of New Scientist and aim to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in science, technology, and environmental sectors. This constant thirst for knowledge and the curiosity to explore how new technological advancements can shape our future is something that keeps me motivated and excited about my work in the tech industry.
