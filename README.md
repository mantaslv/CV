## <a name="about-me">About Me</a>

Hello! I'm Mantas, a full-stack software developer with a background in engineering and seven years of diverse experience in the retail industry. My expertise includes customer-facing interactions, as well as behind-the-scenes work with suppliers, packaging, and data management. With a unique perspective on software development, I am known for being innovative, adaptable, process-driven, detail-oriented, and passionate about collaborating with diverse teams and clients to bring great ideas to life through the power of software.

As someone who is always eager to learn and grow, I am excited to bring my passion for web development to every project I work on. My background in engineering and data analysis has equipped me with the skills to produce simple solutions for complex problems, while consistently delivering high-quality, test-driven code. I thrive on learning through hands-on experience and embrace the philosophy of failing fast to learn quickly, using programming as a platform for continuous growth and improvement.

## <a name="hobbies">Hobbies</a>

- **Rowing**: My other passion. After picking it up at uni, I joined Molesey BC, one of the UK's high-performance centres training full-time 2-3 times a day and qualified to compete at some international club regattas. I still keep up with it recreationally because there is nothing quite like cutting some glass on the River Thames on a crisp Saturday morning!
- **Sports**: Cycling, Running, Weightlifting, anything which allows me to push my body to its limits. I love using my wearable tech (WHOOP) to optimise this process - can't manage what you can't measure!
- **Tech News**: Subscriber of New Scientist, and I try to keep up with all things science, technology, and environment.
