## <a name="about-me">About Me</a>

Hello! I'm Mantas, a software engineer with a background in civil engineering and data analytics, enriched by significant customer and supplier relationship management in the retail sector. I graduated from the Makers Academy bootcamp, where I not only honed my software development skills but also developed a keen interest in software quality assurance. This experience equipped me with a strong foundation in software testing and development, proficient in tools like Postman, Cypress, Selenium, and Playwright, enhancing my capability to ensure software reliability from the ground up.

My engineering degree laid the groundwork for my technical skills, but it was the dynamic and innovative realm of software development—and particularly the precision and impact of quality assurance—that truly captured my engineering spirit. This shift steered me towards a path filled with endless possibilities for creating innovative solutions. Having sharpened my technical and QA skills, I am eager to apply my expertise in software engineering to solve real-world problems. The bootcamp experience reinforced my belief in the power of collaborative learning and iterative development, and I am particularly keen on crafting clean, test-driven code to create intuitive user interfaces and robust backend systems.

As I venture deeper into the tech landscape, I am excited about embracing new challenges, learning from seasoned professionals, and contributing to projects that drive meaningful impact. My blend of engineering discipline, software development, and quality assurance skills positions me to contribute fresh perspectives and innovative solutions in my next professional chapter.

#### Communication
- Presented technical concepts and project demonstrations to technical and non-technical audiences during the final project at Makers Bootcamp.
- Taught Excel tutorial classes to the entire department at M&S, effectively communicating complex information clearly and understandably.
- Led the project to modernise a legacy fabric supplier database and platform, collaborating directly with cross-cultural, global suppliers and the tech team to ensure successful implementation of the new platform.
#### Teamwork and Leadership
- During my time at Makers, I worked on several team agile projects and took turns leading daily standups, retrospectives, and sprint planning sessions. These experiences allowed me to ensure that each team member had clear roles and responsibilities while fostering a collaborative and supportive team culture.
- At Makers, I mentored developers who were more junior than me, providing guidance and support in their learning journey, helping them to overcome obstacles, and fostering a positive and inclusive team dynamic.
#### Adaptability
- Adapted to a new tech stack (MERN) and a legacy codebase while working on the Acebook project with a large team at Makers in a short amount of time. When the team encountered a blocker, I suggested a combination of individual reading and hands-on feature building to help everyone get up to speed. By striking a balance between these approaches, I demonstrated my adaptability techniques and helped the team overcome the challenge.
- Took on new tasks and responsibilities outside of my usual role while moving from team to team in the packaging department at M&S. I brought my tech skills to each team and identified ways to best support them, showing my ability to adapt to different environments and work collaboratively with various stakeholders.
#### Problem-Solving
- During my first project at Makers, MakersBnB, I was part of the smallest group in the cohort with a short project timeline of 1 week. I suggested using a small MVP approach, which allowed us to focus on the core functionalities and prioritise our tasks effectively. As a result, we were able to deliver the most functional project within the given timeframe.
- Identified that data processing was a major bottleneck for our department at M&S and presented a plan to my manager outlining a solution. This involved automating processes using macros and also running Excel tutorial sessions for the department. Took the initiative to learn VBA and successfully implemented the macros, which resulted in a significant increase in efficiency. Additionally, the tutorial classes improved the overall productivity of the team.
#### Time Management
- Successfully completed three projects at Makers by utilising project management tools such as JIRA and T-shirt sizing to prioritise workloads, estimate task complexity and effort required, and ensure timely delivery of high-quality work.
#### Attention to Detail
- Displayed strong attention to detail through the use of code reviews at Makers. I have consistently reviewed my own code and the code of my peers, giving constructive feedback and ensuring that our code met high-quality standards. This process allowed us to catch errors and bugs early on, leading to more efficient development and a better end product.

## <a name="hobbies">Hobbies</a>

- **Rowing**: My other passion. After picking it up at uni, I joined Molesey BC, one of the UK's high-performance centres training full-time 2-3 times a day and qualified to compete at some international club regattas. I still keep up with it recreationally because there is nothing quite like cutting some glass on the river on a crisp Saturday morning!
- **Sports**: Cycling, Running, Weightlifting, anything which allows me to push my body to its limits. I love using my wearable tech to optimise this process - can't manage what you can't measure!
- **Tech News**: I like to keep up with the latest advancements in science, technology, and environmental sectors through podcasts, newsletters and my subscription to the New Scientist.
